      <h1>The blog of a noob!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog! Currently I'm using this blog for a project given to me by my bootcamp at Codeup, but I'm sure this will probably end up being my website!</p>
        
	  <p>Basically, I'm a junior developer with an interest in back end. I'm still learning everything I can do to do the best job I can do. I'm kind of bad at putting my ideas into words, which is probably why I'm becoming a developer in the first place, but I will do my best. Basically, I'm here to become successful in life and to support the life-style that I and my loved ones want.

      <p>Sadly, I'm not super pattionate about coding, but I am pationnate about video-games and being lazy, and while the latter isn't super in-line with my path to success, it's certainly in-line with me being a successful developer. Afterall, what's the point of a developer if you don't get to make everything in life easier? Anyway, I'm just trying to fill up the front page at this point. Also, I'm gold in league of legends, so that's a pretty nice accolade. I wanna get to diamond but I can't while I'm spending so much time coding. Sucks to suck.    
      <p>Anyway, If you want to dive deeper into my world, click the button at the top left and get hyped! </p>
